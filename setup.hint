ldesc: "Qt Jambi is the Qt library made available to Java. The technology
provides new possibilities for both Java and C++ programmers: It enables
Java developers to take the advantage of Qt's features from within Java
Standard Edition 5.0 and Java Enterprise Edition 5.0 as well as later
versions. In addition, Qt Jambi also enables C++ programmers to easily
integrate their Qt code with Java by providing the Qt Jambi generator."
